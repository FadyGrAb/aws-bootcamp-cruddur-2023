# Week 9 â€” CI/CD with CodePipeline, CodeBuild and CodeDeploy
## Required Homework:
### Configuring CodeBuild:
I've configured CodeBuild as per the video instructions (1 and 2) and I made sure it ran successfully. I had some minor difficulties getting CodeBuild to build the image as I switched the build command to use `Dockerfile.prod` instead of the `Dockerfile` in the instructions. And as this file uses some build args, I had to make the necessary adjustments in the `buildspecs.yml`. Also, I tried to pass ***AWS_ACCOUNT_ID*** from the CodePipeline through AWS Console click-ops as I didn't want to pass it in the `buildspecs.yml`, eventually I got it working by using 
```sh
export IMAGE_URL="$AWS_ACCOUNT_ID.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
``` 
in `buildspecs.yml`.
