## Required Homework:

### Implement CFN Networking Layer:

I've created and deployed the CFN Networking layer successfully:  
![net layer success](assests/week10-11/hwreq-0101-cfn-net.png)  
And the following resources were deployed:  
![net layer resources](assests/week10-11/hwreq-0102-cfn-net.png)

### Implement CFN Networking Layer (Diagram):

Due to LucidCharts free tier limitation, I've created the diagram using draw.io. Also, I saw it's better to show the complete diagram at the end of the **Required Homework** section as I couldn't segment the individual layers for writing the journal. For the diagram for this part, please check the [diagram](#physical-layer-diagram) at the end of the **Required Homework** section.

### Implement CFN Cluster Layer:

I've created and deployed the CFN Cluster layer successfully:  
![cluster layer success](assests/week10-11/hwreq-0201-cfn-cluster.png)  
And the following resources were deployed:  
![cluster layer resources](assests/week10-11/hwreq-0202-cfn-cluster.png)

### Implement CFN Toml:

The cfn-toml tool is initiated to be installed via the gitpod.yml file.  
![cfn-toml init](assests/week10-11/hwreq-0301-cfn-toml.png)  
Also, it's integrated in the cfn scripts as in the below example:
![cfn-toml integration](assests/week10-11/hwreq-0302-cfn-toml.png)

### Implement CFN Service Layer for Backend:

I've created and deployed the CFN Service Layer for Backend successfully:  
![Service layer success](assests/week10-11/hwreq-0401-cfn-service.png)  
And the following resources were deployed:  
![Service layer resources](assests/week10-11/hwreq-0402-cfn-service.png)

- Target Group Healthy service status
  ![Target Group](assests/week10-11/hwreq-0403-cfn-service-tg-healthy.png)
- **_backend-flask_** service Healthy status from ECS:
  ![ECS backend-flask](assests/week10-11/hwreq-0404-cfn-service-flask.png)

### Implement CFN Database Layer (RDS):

I've created and deployed the CFN Database Layer successfully:  
![Database layer success](assests/week10-11/hwreq-0501-cfn-db.png)  
And the following resources were deployed:  
![Database layer resources](assests/week10-11/hwreq-0502-cfn-db.png)

### Implement Service and Database (Diagram):

For the diagram for this part, please check the [diagram](#physical-layer-diagram) at the end of the **Required Homework** section.

### Implement DynamoDB using SAM:

I've created and deployed the CFN DynamoDB Layer successfully:  
![DynamoDB layer success](assests/week10-11/hwreq-0601-cfn-ddb.png)  
And the following resources were deployed:  
![DynamoDB layer resources](assests/week10-11/hwreq-0602-cfn-ddb.png)

### Implement DynamoDB (Diagram):

For the diagram for this part, please check the [diagram](#physical-layer-diagram) at the end of the **Required Homework** section.

### Implement CI/CD:

I've created and deployed the CFN CI/CD Layer successfully:  
![CI/CD layer success](assests/week10-11/hwreq-0701-cfn-cicd.png)  
And the following resources were deployed:  
![CI/CD layer resources](assests/week10-11/hwreq-0702-cfn-cicd.png)

### Implement CI/CD (Diagram):

For the diagram for this part, please check the [diagram](#physical-layer-diagram) at the end of the **Required Homework** section.

### Implement CFN Static Website Hosting for Frontend:

I've created and deployed the CFN Static Website Hosting for Frontend Layer successfully:  
![Static Website Hosting for Frontend layer success](assests/week10-11/hwreq-0801-cfn-frontend.png)  
And the following resources were deployed:  
![Static Website Hosting for Frontend layer resources](assests/week10-11/hwreq-0802-cfn-frontend.png)

### Physical layer diagram:

## Homework Challenges:

### Continued my JWT sid-car cognito verifier implementation:

I've deployed my side-car service **_cognito-verifier_** as a separate service and the **_backend-flask_** and **_cognito-verifier_** services are communicating via Service Connect DNS using the discovery name property.  
Also, in order to enable intra-services communication in the services security group, I've added a **_AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress_** resource to the **_ServiceSG_** in the Cluster template to allow all traffic within the security group.

```yaml
ServiceSGIngress:
  # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-ec2-security-group-ingress.html
  Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroupIngress
  Properties:
    GroupId: !GetAtt ServiceSG.GroupId
    Description: CruddurServices
    IpProtocol: -1
    SourceSecurityGroupId: !GetAtt ServiceSG.GroupId
```

Deployed side-car service:

**_cognito-verifier_** (side-car) service heathy status:
