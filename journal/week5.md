## Required Homework:

### Implement Schema Load Script

I've created the _cruddur-messages_ table and the _message-group-sk-index_ GSI with the _schema-load_ script as instructed.

### Implement Seed Script

I've created the seed script with one modification is that instead of using "andrewbrown" as my user and "bayko" as the other user, I used one of my Cognito users "fod" as my user and "other_fady" and the other user. That way I could use the Cognito Update ID script on my data. Also, I've set the base time for the seed messages to be 3 hours in the past so that every new message I create will be in after the seed messages. Without that, I would have issues displaying the new messages I create if I test it right after the seed.

### Implement Scan Script

I've created the scan script as instructed.

### Implement Update Cognito ID Script for Postgres Database

I've implemented the update Cognito ID script.

### Implement (Pattern A) Listing Messages in Message Group into Application

I've implemented Pattern A and was able to show the messages from a message group in the app.

### Implement (Pattern B) Listing Messages Group into Application

I've implemented Pattern B and was able list the message groups in the app.

### Implement (Pattern C) Creating a Message for an existing Message Group into Application

I was able to create a new message for an _existing_ message group (Pattern C) as follows:

### Implement (Pattern D) Creating a Message for a new Message Group into Application

I've implemented the "create message for new message groups" (Pattern D) as follows:

### Implement (Pattern E) Updating a Message Group using DynamoDB Streams

I've created the ddb table and GSI and enabled dynamodb streams (Pattern E):
