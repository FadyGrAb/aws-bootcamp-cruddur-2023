# Week 5 â€” DynamoDB and Serverless Caching
## Required Homework:
### Implement Schema Load Script
I've created the *cruddur-messages* table and the *message-group-sk-index* GSI with the *shcema-load* script as instructed.

### Implement Seed Script
I've created the seed script with one modification is that instead of using "andrewbrown" as my user and "bayko" as the other user, I used one of my Cognito users "fod" as my user and "other_fady" and the other user. That way I could use the Cognito Update ID script on my data. Also, I've set the base time for the seed messages to be 3 hours in the past so that every new message I create will be in afte the seed messages. Without that, I would have issues displaying the new messages I create if I test it right after the seed.
