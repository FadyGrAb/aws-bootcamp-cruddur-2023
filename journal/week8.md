# Week 8 â€” Serverless Image Processing
## Required Homeworkd
### Implement CDK Stack:
I've bootstraped the CDK and created the serverless stack with the typescript CDK. I've followed the instructions without facing any problems.
* CFN CDK stacks:

* CFN CDK stack resources:

### Serve Avatars via CloudFront:
I've setup the CloudFront distribution with a custom domain to serve assests from my "assets.mydomain" s3 bucket and created a Rout53 record for the distribution.

* The S3 bucket as an origin in the distribution

* The distribution's Route53 Record

* Example of a successful assets fetch from the app  
***TODO: serving example***
### Implement Users Profile Page:
I've Implemented the user profile page that shows the banner, avatar, display name and Bio.  
***TODO: Profile page***
### Implement Users Profile Form:
I've Implemented the user profile form where we can change the display name, bio and avatar.
***TODO: Profile form***
### Implement Backend Migrations:
I've impleneted the backend database migrations and rollbacks. I have made a small modification to the timestamp as I've found that sometimes the number of milli-seconds digit provided by `time.time()` are inconsistent and can change. And when removing the "." this could lead to wrong comparisons. So I've removed the decimal part altogether as I don't think it will impact the functionalty but instead the behaviour will be predictable.
```python
# bin/db/migrate
if last_successful_run <= file_time:
    ...
    timestamp = str(time.time()).split(".")[0]
    last_successful_run = set_last_successful_run(timestamp)
```
```python
# bin/generate/migration
...
timestamp = str(time.time()).split(".")[0]

filename = f"{timestamp}_{name}.py"
...
```
***TODO: Migration Demo***
### Presigned URL generation via Ruby Lambda:
I've generated a presigned URL using the Ruby lambda function and implemented a conditional run depending on the calling HTTP method either OPTIONS (CORS preflight) or POST. And used it to successfully upload the file to the S3 bucket. I made sure to set the response's CORS headers and the S3 CORS policy are correct first.
***TODO: Calling API gatway dev/tools***  

***TODO: upload Demo***  
### HTTP API Gateway with Lambda Authorizer:
I've configured the HTTP API Gateway and used a Lambda Authorizer that will trigger at each /avatars/key_upload POST HTTP call.
* `/avatars/key_upload` POST route with authorizer and integration Lambdas:
![key_upload](assests/week08/hwreq-0701-apigateway-key_upload.png)
* `/{proxy+}` HTTP_PROXY OPTIONS route with only integration Lambda:
![proxy](assests/week08/hwreq-0702-apigateway-http-proxy.png)
* Authorizer logs after each request:
***TODO: Authorizer logs***  
### Create JWT Lambda Layer:
I've created the needed scripts to generate and upload the layer. And I have attached it to the pre-signing lambda.

### Render Avatars in App via CloudFront:
I was able to upload the avatars to the assets S3 bucket using the cognito user UUID as its filename and also serve it via cloud front. I noticed some errors in the browser dev tools console complaining about "undefined" avatars. After further investigation, It was due to the hard-coded @andrewbrown user which I don't have in my Cognito user pool. I've applied a quick fix to that until we use the CloudFront function to serve a default avatar is if the `props.id` is `null` (or `undefined`), set the `backgroundimage` to `none` in the ***ProfileAvatar*** component.
```js
//ProfileAvatar.js
export default function ProfileAvatar(props) {
  var backgroundImage = "none"
  if (props.id != null) {
    backgroundImage = `url("https://assets.crudderme.click/avatars/${props.id}.jpg")`
  } 
  const styles = {
    backgroundImage: backgroundImage,
    ...
  };
```
