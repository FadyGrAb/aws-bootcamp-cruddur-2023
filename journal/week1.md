# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Required Homework:
### Containerize Application (Dockerfiles, Docker Compose)
I've built the backend and frontend containers using Dockerfile  
Running backend-flask (build from Dockerfile)

/api/activities/home response  
![backend response](assests/week01/reqhw-dockerize-backend-dockerfile%2002.png)
   
    
Runing frontend-react-js (build from Dockerfile)

Frontend page

And with docker compose

Frontend while running with docker compose using the backend API

### Document the Notification Endpoint for the OpenAPI Document:

### Write a Flask Backend Endpoint for Notifications:

### Write a React Page for Notifications:

### Run DynamoDB Local Container and ensure it works:
Running `docker compose ps` after `docker compose up -d` to see all the running containers. The DynamomDB container (and postgres container) are highligted.

<br>
And to ensure that dynamodb is working, I've created the table and added the item as in the instructions then listed them out.

### Run Postgres Container and ensure it works:
As for postges, I've logged in as the '*postgres*' user as instructed and listed all the databases in the db with `\l`.

## Homework chalenges:
### Intalling Docker on my local machine and running the same containers:

I've installed Docker Desktop on windows on my local enviornment and ran the containers.  
Running docker from vscode's terminal:

Docker desktop on Windows:
