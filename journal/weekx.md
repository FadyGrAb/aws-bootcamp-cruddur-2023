## Required Homework:

### Week X Sync tool for static website hosting:

I've created the `sync` and the `static-build` scripts in `bin/frontend/` but configured them to work in with Github Actions on a `push` to `prod` branch.
Details are in the homework challenges [section](#using-github-actions-to-build-and-sync-the-static-website) related to this part

### Reconnect DB and Postgres Confirmation Lambda

The CFN created RDS instance is reconnected and new users are inserted by the post-confirmation-lambda.  
![rds and post confirmation lambda](./assests/week-x/hwrq-0101-rds.gif)

### Fix CORS to use domain name for web-app

I've fixed all the CORS issues and the web-app is working normally using the domain name `crudderme.click`  
![cors](./assests/week-x/hwrq-0201-cors.gif)

### Ensure CI/CD pipeline works and create activity works

The CI/CD pipeline is finishing all the _source_, _build_ and _deploy_ stages successfully.  
![cicd](./assests/week-x/hwrq-0301-cicd.gif)

And the _Create Activity_ also works on prod using the `crudderme.click` domain.  
![create activity](./assests/week-x/hwrq-0302-create-activity.gif)

### Refactor to use JWT Decorator in Flask App

I'm using my sid-cart cognito verifier and I've modified the middleware to use decorators:

```python
def jwt_required(self, func=None, on_error=None):
    if func is None:
        return partial(self.jwt_required, on_error=on_error)

    @wraps(func)
    def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
        try:
            if self.token_is_valid:
                return func(*args, **kwargs)
            elif on_error:
                return on_error(*args, **kwargs)
            else:
                return {}, 403
        except TokenNotFoundException as e:
            print(e)
            return {}, 401

    return decorated_function
```

### Refactor app.py

I've refactored the `app.py` as instructed. And I've re-introduced my `Telemetry Module` which I've created in [week 02](./week2.md/#creating-a-seperate-telemetry-module)

### Refactor Flask Routes

I've refactored the routes as instructed and separated the routes in individual modules:
![routes](./assests/week-x/hwrq-0601-refactoring.png)

```python
# Load routes
routes.activities.load(app, cognito_verifier, telemetry_agent)
routes.general.load(app)
routes.users.load(app, cognito_verifier, telemetry_agent)
routes.messages.load(app, cognito_verifier, telemetry_agent)
```

### Implement Replies for Posts

Replies are implemented and tested on prod deployment  
![replies](./assests/week-x/hwrq-0701-replies.gif)

### Improved Error Handling for the app

I've implemented the Error Handling in `Requests.js` and applied it in the React.js components  
![errors](./assests/week-x/hwrq-0801-error-handling.png)

### Activities Show Page

The _ActivitiesShowPage_ is implemented and a route is added to the `App.js` file

```js
{
    path: "/@:handle/status/:activity_uuid",
    element: <ActivityShowPage />
  },
```

### More General Cleanup Part 1 and Part 2

I've done all the cleanup in the instructional videos in addition to some of my own:

#### Only show activities in the activities page and exclude the replies:

This is done by returning

```sql
activities.reply_to_activity_uuid
```

in both the `backend-flask/db/sql/activities/home.sql` and `backend-flask/db/sql/activities/show.sql` then check it from the frontend. If it's `undefined` in the _HomeFeedPage_, then don't show it.  
![exclude replies](./assests/week-x/hwrq-0901-exclude-replies.gif)

#### Hide the Activities Content if the user isn't logged in

If the user isn't logged in, he/she shouldn't have access to the Activities Contents (Notifications, Messages, Profile). So I've implemented that:  
![hide content](./assests/week-x/hwrq-0902-hide-content.gif)

#### Show profile picture for users in the _HomeFeedPage_:

![profile pictures](./assests/week-x/hwrq-0903-profile-pictures.png)

#### Fix signin page error handling:

I've fixed an error introduced when the [Error Handling](#improved-error-handling-for-the-app) part is implemented. The Signin page doesn't return an Array, so I've modified the code in `frontend-react-js/src/components/FormErrors.js` to accommodate that.

```js
if (props.errors.length > 0 && Array.isArray(props.errors)) {
  el_errors = (
    <div className="errors">
      {props.errors.map((err_code, key) => {
        return <FormErrorItem err_code={err_code} key={key} />;
      })}
    </div>
  );
} else if (props.errors.length > 0) {
  el_errors = (
    <div className="errors">
      <FormErrorItem err_code={props.errors} key={0} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Homework Challenges:

### Using Github Actions to build and sync the static website:

I've configured a Github Actions workflow to build the static website then sync it with the predefined S3 bucket to host the static website. The workflow consists of _one job_ that contains the following steps:

- **Checkout**: To checkout the branch into the workflow.
- **Setup Node 18**: Install Node 18 for the build stage.
- **Build site**: Build with React.js scripts (CI env var must be set to false to not treat warnings as errors as this stops the workflow).
- **Init Ruby environment**: Install Ruby runtime.
- **Sync static site**: Syncing the statics website with the sync tool.

I had to modify the `bin/frontend/sync` script a bit to be able to integrate Github Actions. I've added the following condition for the script to initiate some vars differently if it's run within Github Actions context. It uses the env var `GITHUB_ACTIONS_WORKFLOW` and checks if it's `true` or not.

```ruby
# bin/frontend/sync
if ENV["GITHUB_ACTIONS_WORKFLOW"]
  changeset_path =    "tmp/sync-changeset.json"
  build_dir =         "frontend-react-js/build"
  auto_approve =      "true"
  env_path =          "sync.env"
else
  changeset_path =    ENV["SYNC_OUTPUT_CHANGESET_PATH"]
  build_dir =         ENV["SYNC_BUILD_DIR"]
  auto_approve =      ENV["SYNC_AUTO_APPROVE"]
  env_path =          "/workspace/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/sync.env"
end
```

### Creating a real-time AI moderator using TensorFlow.js:

For this one, I've use TensorFlow.js pre-trained model, the [text toxicity detection model](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/toxicity), to block a user's Crud or Reply if they are offending. The moderator disables the Crud/submit button if the entered text by the user showed any kind of toxicity and shows a message to him/her about the found toxicity categories. This is done by integrating a React.js component with the model.  
The model is downloaded in the users browser and no cloud services are used for inference. In order to avoid model re-downloads, I've used te `useEffect` React.js feature.

```js
useEffect(() => {
  async function loadModel() {
    const model = await toxicityClassifier.load(0.6);
    setModel(model);
  }
  if (model === null) {
    loadModel();
  }
  if (toxicity.length !== 0) {
    setErrors(["Please be polite to be able to Crud!"]);
  } else {
    setErrors([]);
  }
}, [model, message, toxicity]);
```

The `useEffect` feature to execute code outside of React rendering life cycle. So, the previous function won't be executed at render-time and will be executed only if one or more of _model_, _message_ or, _toxicity_ have changed. Basically, it checks if the _model_ is loaded or not. And if not, it will load it. Also it takes advantage of the [improved error handling](#improved-error-handling-for-the-app) we have introduced and shows the "toxicity" as an error.  
The Model evaluate the text entered by the user during the `onChange` and the `onBlur` events of the activity form text area component which may introduce some lag when typing. But mostly it isn't noticeable.

```js
const textarea_onchange = async (event) => {
  setCount(event.target.value.length);
  setMessage(event.target.value);

  // toxicity detection
  const predictions = await model.classify([message]);
  setToxicity(
    predictions
      .filter((item) => item.results[0].match === true)
      .map((item) => item.label)
  );
};
```

This function only sets `toxicity` to an array of the results "labels" where `match === true`. This is how the model results are structured in its docs.  
Finally, the `toxicity` array is passed to a `ToxicityMeter` React.js component where it can be nicely showed to the user.
